<H2> Problem </H2>
<ul> A man wants to go to his condominium at the fastest time possible. He has two options. First he could drive his car East on the smooth 
road for 400 km, then north on the rocky road for 1000 km. The maximum speed of the car in the smooth road is 80 km/hr and the maximum speed 
of the car on the rocky road is only 30 km/hr. Driving straight to the rocky road would reduce the distance but the speed would be very slow.

<ul>His possible choices involve going through the entire smooth road, then to the rocky road...<br>

..or by going to the straight road for a little bit then straight towards the condominium using the rocky road.<br>

<H2> Problem </H2>
<ul>The solution is to use optimization with differentials. Driving straight to the rocky road would reduce the distance but the speed would be very slow. <br>
If he chooses to drive 400 km on the smooth road then straight to the rocky road, he would minimize the time on the rocky road but the distance would be very long.<br>

Since 404 is not included on the interval [0,400], the minimum time should occur on either one of the endpoints.<br>

<br>
<IMG SRC ="criticalPoints.png">
<br>In conclusion, time is minimized when x is equal to 400. That is when the man drives straight towards the condominium through the rocky road.<br><IMG SRC ="car-animation-3.gif" height="300" width="400"><br><br>
